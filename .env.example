# TESTING WITH LIVE CREDENTIALS
# ===============================================
# To test switching from mock to live mode:
#
# 1. SANDBOX TESTING (Recommended first step):
#    - Set VISA_ACCEPTANCE_ENVIRONMENT=SANDBOX
#    - Set CYBS_ENVIRONMENT=SANDBOX  
#    - Use your sandbox credentials from Visa Developer Portal
#    - Test all operations without real money
#
# 2. PRODUCTION TESTING (Only after sandbox testing):
#    - Set VISA_ACCEPTANCE_ENVIRONMENT=PRODUCTION
#    - Set CYBS_ENVIRONMENT=PRODUCTION
#    - Use production credentials
#    - ⚠️  WARNING: This processes real transactions
#
# 3. MODE SWITCHING:
#    - Demo Mode: Mock responses, no API calls
#    - Live Mode: Real API calls to Visa Acceptance
#    - Toggle via UI or API: POST /api/mode/toggle
